# Project Overview: Stage 1

## About

This is Erika Miguel's submission for the Restaurant Reviews project of Udacity's Front End Nanodegree. Subsequent code revisions from the master branch were made by the author.

## Development

1. The main html files are `index.html` and `restaurant.html`
2. JavaScript assets are in the `js` folder
3. CSS Assets are in the `css` folder
4. The service worker file is called `sw.js`


### Running the development server

In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
